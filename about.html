            Hi, my name is Taylor. I am a 23 year old Software Development
            student located in Melbourne, Victoria. At this current time, I am a
            couple of weeks away from completing my Diploma of Software
            Development at Swinburne University of Technology. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe myself to be a highly motivated and dedicated worker, with
            strong Communication, Team Work, and People skills. Throughout the
            course of my studies, I have been presented with situations of solo
            working, as well as working in teams to get certain projects
            completed. This has allowed me to get a sense of Problem Solving and
            Time Management alone, and working in a group where tasks need to be
            assigned and completed amongst members. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a keen interest in the Software Development field and I am
            currently seeking a Junior Position to nurture me, progress my
            skills and assist me in kickstarting a career in this wonderful and
            exciting industry.
          </p>

            Over the duration of this course, I gained experience developing in
            Industry Relevant languages, platforms and practices, with an
            emphasis on developing my Problem-Solving and Team-Work skills. The
            main languages focused on were C# WPF Applications, MySQL, XML,
            Basic JSON, ASP.Net MVC, and basic HTML and CSS. The main platforms
            focused on were Entity Framework and Microsoft Azure, whilst also
            learning useful software like Visual Studio Team Services (now Azure
            DevOps), Sparx Enterprise Architect, and more in-depth Microsoft
            Project.
