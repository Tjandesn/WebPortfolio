                <p>Hello! My name is Taylor, and I am a 23 year old Software Development
                    student located in Melbourne, Victoria. At this current time, I have
                    just under 2 months remaining on my Diploma at Swinburne University of
                    Technology. I have a keen interest in Software Development, and I am
                    hoping to gain entry into the industry with a Junior Position that will
                    nurture me, help me to further progress my skills, and really make a
                    career out of this! <br>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with mates, online gaming, reading,
                    watching movies, and keeping fit by attending the gym 7 days a week.
                </p>
